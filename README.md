# Customer Churn Prediction
The model demonstrates a Customer Churn Predictor model which predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not. The model also calculates the likelihood or the probability of person to churn or not churn. The model has been tested with multiple number of Machine Learning algorithms for achieving the best accuracy.
The overview of the project is given in this document.
